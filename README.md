# koWloon (generic) notes

Kgn is an app with notes inside notes all the way down to more notes. <br />
A Note can be attached to a Node which in turn can have subnodes inside it and on so on. It's really all there is to it.

Kgn is still in development, it might lose notes due to bugs, it is advised to backup often.
